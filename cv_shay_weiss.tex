\section{Added Value}
Software development, craftsmanship and engineering has always been a passion of mine.\\
It is a privilege to be able to make a living off of a hobby I enjoy pursuing. \\
I have been tinkering with software since childhood and have been writing and designing software which is effective, readable \& maintainable since.
I have evolved and matured with my experience as a software engineer and I strive that my work will be guided by: \\
\begin{itemize}
\item "Done is better than Perfect"
\item "Make data driven decisions" (It's immensely satisfying to see the results of your work make a visual and measurable impact on a key metric graph)
\item "A line of code is written once but is read many times"
\item "Be Pragmatic"
\end{itemize}
I am a good people manager and product owner. \\
I love being part of the big picture and make sure everyone are happy and on the same page. \\
I cultivate strong communication skills based on honesty, transparency and openness. \\
A strong negotiator and conflict diffuser. Well rounded in soft skills.
\\
